Abstract 

We develop a framework for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses 
of firms engaged in providing services, synthesizing and building on the 
literature addressing service operations. First, we summarize the 
distinguishing characteristics of service products, as compared to 
manufactured goods. We then partition the context in which firms operate 
into three segments. The external environment encompasses product 
definition and differentiation, as well as competitive forces. The internal 
environment concerns issues similar to those in traditional management of 
manufacturing operations. The customer interface is the most critical 
segment, representing the service firm's "moment of truth." We discuss 
each environment in turn. 



L Introduction 

The service sector has become an important part of the world 
economy over the past several decades, as manufacturings share of total 
employment and output has fallen dramatically. ^ Furthermore, service 
has become an important feature of manufactured products; repair and 
maintenance, sales, and training are examples of services that enhance 
and differentiate manufactured products. Today, there are very few firms 
that do not view providing service as part of their strategy. In this paper, 
we develop a framework for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of 
service operations. There is a growing body of literature focusing on 
management of operations in service firms, and we use this work as 
fundamental building blocks in creating a unified framework. We begin by 
partitioning the context in which a firm operates into three segments: the 
external environment, the internal environment, and the customer 
interface. We then summarize the characteristics that distinguish service 
products from manufactured products. These characteristics will be our 
focus for the three remaining sections of the paper, in which we discuss 
each segment in depth. 

EL The Framework 

It is useful to classify the questions that we address according to the 
environments to which they pertain. Figure 1 illustrates this basic 
framework. 2 Although it can not capture all of the complexity of the firm's 
environment, the framework presents a way of thinking about the 
relationships between the major functions and participants in service 
operations.

This Investigation Report summarizes the results of studies undertaken to characterize the 
extent of soil and groundwater contamination at the Former A Range on the Massachusetts 
Military Reservation (MMR). The Former A Range Investigation was conducted under 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Safe Drinking Water Act Administrative Orders SDWA 
1-97-1019 and SDWA 1-2000-0014, and in consideration of the substantive cleanup standards 
of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP). 

The Former A Range (also known as the Gravity Anti-Tank Range) is an inactive anti-tank 
artillery and rocket practice range. It is located to the west of the Camp Edwards Impact Area in 
the southern portion of Training Area B-9. Wood Road and Training Area B-8 lie to the 
immediate south. The range was originally constructed in 1941 and functioned as an anti-tank 
artillery and rocket site until the 1960s. A prominent feature of the range was the gravity 
propelled movement of cars along a short downhill rail line to provide moving targets. During the 
early 1960s to the mid-1970s, the range was used for machine gun practice. 

Groundwater monitoring data for four wells on the range indicate the presence of trace levels of 
a few explosives-related compounds. 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and two of its degradation 
products 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2A-DNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4A-DNT) were 
observed at low concentrations (<1.0 microgram per liter [|ig/L]) in one well (MW-249M3) 
downgradient of the target area, although not in well MW-206S immediately beneath the target 
area. The explosives compounds hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 1,3,5- 
trinitrobenzene were also detected once in MW-249M3 at concentrations of 0.31 J |ig/L and 
0.33J |ig/L, respectively. 

Overall investigation results indicate that the principal contaminants detected in soils at the 
range are explosives, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and metals. These 
contaminants are primarily observed in the target area of the range. Detections of these 
contaminants were sporadic. Explosives, SVOCs, and/or metals contaminants in soils are co- 
located at some but not all sampling locations. 

Explosives compounds were detected in a limited number of surface and shallow subsurface 
soil samples located throughout the target area. The principal explosives that were observed 
include TNT and its degradation products, 2A-DNT and 4A-DNT. The highest reported TNT 
concentration (9 milligrams per kilogram [mg/Kg]) was observed in the backstop berm portions 
of the target area. The highest levels of 2A-DNT (6.8 mg/Kg) and 4A-DNT (2.4 mg/Kg) were 
reported in the lower berm portions of the target area. Explosives compounds were detected 
infrequently and at low concentrations in soil samples located outside the target area berms. 
Semivolatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds were also detected 
sporadically at several locations within the target area. However, most of the higher observed 
PAH concentrations were clustered in surface and shallow subsurface soils along portions of 
the rail line. Maximum observed values of most of the more frequently detected PAHs, including 
fluoranthene (47 mg/Kg), phenanthrene (45 mg/Kg), and pyrene (40 mg/Kg), were all detected 
at various surface soil locations along the rail line.

the battle also. It will be noted that where modern 
ships are illustrated they are, where possible, rejjro- 
duced from photographs. When otherwise, they are 
in each case drawn either from my own sketches of 
the actual ships or from photographs that did not 
lend themselves to direct reproduction. 

As everyone has his own rendering of Russian 
spelling, and as of many ships several widely different 
spellings are in existence, the more popular forms of 
spelling are here and there adopted. As a general rule, 
however, the correct more or less phonetic spelling 
suitable for the English language is also introduced. 

The name Ksenia — Xenia, or Zenia — is a case in 
point, the first being a Russian spelling, the last an 
English adaption. When possible the phonetic sound 
is indicated by the use of accents over the vowels 
in order to avoid an ugly appearance. Rossia and 
Sevastopol are names in point. 

The matter is not one of supreme importance, and 
is only drawn attention to because in a number of 
cases the usual English pronunciation bears no relation 
at all to the Russian one. When such a simple name 
as Rossia is s]3elt in English (as it occasionally is) 
" Rossija," and recklessly pronounced " Rossyjar," one 
may well acquit the Russian officer who told an 
Englishman that they had no such ship in their 
Navy.

relations, though some definite alterations have since 
been made, appeared serially in the Daily Chronicle,

Fourth Method^. Ask some one to select a number less

(i) To multiply it by 10, and to add any number he pleases,

this digit is e. Then, if the numbers a, b, c, d, e are known,

viously mentioned.

remainder when a - b + 3 (c - d) is divided by 9, we have 
x = e, y = 9 — r. 

The demonstration is not difficult. Suppose the selected num- 
ber is 9a; + y. Step (i) gives 90a: + lOy + a. Let y + a = 3n + b, 
then the quotient obtained in step (ii) is 30x + 2y + n. Step 
(in) gives 300a; + 30y + 10n, + c. Let n + c = 3m + d, then the 
quotient obtained in step (iv) is 100a; + lOy + 3n + m, which I 
will denote by Q. Now the third digit in Q must be x, because, 
since y if- 8 and a $■ 9, we have n ^ 5 ; and since n^-5 and c ^ 9, 
we have m ^ 4 ; therefore lOy + 3n + m $■ 99. Hence the third 
or hundreds digit in Q is x. 

Again, from the relations y + a = 3w + b and n + c = 3m + d, 
we have 9m — y = a-b + 3(c — d): hence, if r is the remainder 
when a — b + 3 (c — d) is divided by 9, we have y = 9 — r. [This 
is always true, if we make r positive ; but if a — b + 3 (c — d) 
is negative, it is simpler to take y as equal to its numerical 
value ; or we may prevent the occurrence of this case by 
assigning proper values to a and c.J Thus x and y are both 
known, and therefore the number selected, namely 9x + y, is 
known. 

Fifth Method*. Ask any one to select a number less 
than 60. Eequest him to perform the following operations, 
(i) To divide it by 3 and mention the remainder ; suppose it 
to be a. (ii) To divide it by 4, and mention the remainder; 
suppose it to be b. (iii) To divide it by 5, and mention the 
remainder; suppose it to be c. Then the number selected is 
the remainder obtained by dividing 40a + 456 + 36c by 60. 

This method can be generalized and then will apply to any 
number chosen. Let a', 6', c', ... be a series of numbers prime 
to one another, and let p be their product. Let n be any 
number less than p, and let a, b, c, ... be the remainders 
when n is divided by a, b', c', . . . respectively. Find a number 
A which is a multiple of the product b'c'd' . . . and which 
exceeds by unity a multiple of a'. Find a number B which is 
a multiple of a'c'd' ... and which exceeds by unity a multiple

F. MESSAGE BIT INDEPENDENT INSERTION PROTOCOLS 

The protocols in the previous section require the receiver to have both the original 
wrapper file and the stegotext to extract the message. This is because the insertion point 
bit(s) are selected based on the value of the message bit. Therefore the only way for the 
receiver to identify the insertion points is to compare the wrapper with the stegotext. This 
is entirely different from the key- or algorithm-based protocol event selection techniques 
mentioned earlier. 

Frequently, it is inconvenient or impossible for the receiver to have the original 
wrapper file. For example, in an image downgrading scenario, it is possible for a misfeasor 
to embed classified data in an image which he expects to be downgraded. Once the wrapper 
image is downgraded, the original wrapper file is no longer available to be used for 
comparison in an extraction algorithm For this reason, when designing a steganographic
